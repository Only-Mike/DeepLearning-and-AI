# Search using SBERT <br>
<br>
*** This assingment is created by Lina, Snorre and Mike *** <br>

For this assingment we have created a search engine using SBERT. For demonstration we have used both Semantic search and cosine similiarity, even though semantic search already contains cosine similarity. <br>
The dataset is created using randormwordgenerator.com and ChatGPT. The dataset is then put into a list containing strings for embedding. <br>



## Conclusion to search engine using SBERT <br>
Semantic search and cosine similarity has the same accuray as expected, though we ran into some problems showing the sentence in Gradio when using semantic search and showing the five closest in cosine similarity. <br>
Therefore we chose to have both to show that both works. For this assignment cosine similarity would have been sufficient but if we had a "real" project with lots of data the semantic search would be preferable.
