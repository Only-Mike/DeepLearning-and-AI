# DeepLearning-and-AI 
The Group consists of Lina, Snorre and Mike.


The data chosen for the group 1 assignment is the penguin dataset, which consist of several features including flipper lengt, culmen length, culmen width and body mass in grams

From looking through the different Neural Networks with the different hyper-parameters it seems like Neural Network 2 has the best loss results as the loss is declining for each pass quite steadily. 

The different Neural Networks had each some differences:

## Neural Network 1
epochs 100  <br />
learning rate 0.01
2 hidden layers with 6 and 5 neurons
3 input variables
Identity for the output layer function
MSE loss function

## Neural Network 2
epochs 100
learning rate 0.01
2 hidden layers with 6 and 5 neurons
3 input variables
Sigmoid for the output layer function
MSE Loss Function

## Neural Network 3
epochs 100
learning rate 0.01
2 hidden layers with 6 and 5 neurons
3 input variables
Identity for the output layer function
L1 loss function

## Neural Network 4
epochs 100
learning rate 0.01
2 hidden layers with 6 and 5 neurons
3 input variables
Sigmoid for the output layer function
L1 Loss funtion

## Neural Network 5
epochs 100
learning rate 0.005
3 hidden layers with 6, 6 and 5 neurons
3 input variables
Sigmoid for the output layer function
MSE Loss function
