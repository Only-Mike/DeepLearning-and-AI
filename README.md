<br>
Assignment 1
---------------
<br> 
Assignment 1 consist of a normal ANN to showcase how a simple ANN works. There are 5 different Neural Nets, each with their own parameters.
<br> 
The dataset used for this is the penguin dataset from https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins/raw/5b5891f01b52ae26ad8cb9755ec93672f49328a8/data/penguins_size.csv
<br>

Assignment 2
---------------
<br>
Assignment 2 consist of a CNN to showcase how a relatively simple Convolutional Network works and a LSTM network with the attempt to predict the weather from a weather dataset.
<br> 
The dataset used for the CNN is MNIST dataet. For the LSTM data we have used a weather dataset containing weather for eachh month from 2000 until 2020
