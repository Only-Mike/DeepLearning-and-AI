# DeepLearning-and-AI 

 
Intro
---------------
<br> The Group consists of Lina, Snorre and Mike.
<br>
<br> 
You can find more detailed explainations of the individual assignment from README's in each assigment folder.
<br>
Each Assignment is created in Google Colab and has a Google Colab button in the top left corner. 
<br>
Each assignment differs in difficulty but is somehow in order from assignment 1 being the "easiest" and assignment 4 being the most complicated. 
<br>
Furthermore assigment 4 can be found and tested on HuggingFace following this link --> https://huggingface.co/spaces/Only-Mike/ADHD_QA_Bot


<br>
Assignment 1
---------------
<br> 
Assignment 1 consist of a normal ANN to showcase how a simple ANN works. There are 5 different Neural Nets, each with their own parameters.
<br> 
The dataset used for this is the penguin dataset from https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins/raw/5b5891f01b52ae26ad8cb9755ec93672f49328a8/data/penguins_size.csv
<br>

Assignment 2
---------------
<br>
Assignment 2 consist of a CNN to showcase how a relatively simple Convolutional Network works and a LSTM network with the attempt to predict the weather from a weather dataset.
<br> 
The dataset used for the CNN is MNIST dataet. For the LSTM data we have used a weather dataset containing weather for eachh month from 2000 until 2020 
<br> 
The dataset can be found on Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/poojag718/rainfall-timeseries-data?fbclid=IwAR2pFvjUGGDVxqHG3ETGTcUxkz_xE4l2T--HO6nFFf78mHq6u_egLEJX8iw
